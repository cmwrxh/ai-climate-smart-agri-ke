# Evaluation Rubric — Climate-Smart Agriculture AI (Kenya)

This rubric helps evaluate solutions beyond accuracy: usefulness, fairness, safety, and deployability matter.

Score each category 0–3:
- 0 = not addressed
- 1 = weak
- 2 = acceptable
- 3 = strong

---

## 1) Predictive Performance (0–3)
- Accuracy or error metrics appropriate to task (forecasting/classification)
- Baseline comparisons included (rule-based, seasonal average)
- Performance stable across time periods

Evidence:
- Metrics table
- Baseline comparison

---

## 2) Explainability & Actionability (0–3)
- Outputs are understandable to non-technical users
- Recommendations are practical (what to do next)
- Confidence/uncertainty is communicated clearly

Evidence:
- Example outputs
- User feedback notes

---

## 3) Data Quality & Coverage (0–3)
- Data schema followed consistently
- Missing data handled transparently
- Coverage across counties/regions is stated

Evidence:
- Data dictionary usage
- Missingness report

---

## 4) Fairness & Inclusion (0–3)
- No group is systematically disadvantaged (region, language, farm size proxy)
- Smallholders are not excluded by design
- Accessibility considered (low bandwidth, low-cost access)

Evidence:
- Segment evaluation
- Inclusion notes

---

## 5) Safety & Harm Prevention (0–3)
- Avoids unsafe recommendations (e.g., pesticide misuse)
- Provides warnings and referral guidance where appropriate
- Does not amplify misinformation about weather/pests

Evidence:
- Safety rules
- Red-team or stress testing notes

---

## 6) Privacy, Consent & Data Governance (0–3)
- Consent strategy described for farmer data
- Minimal data collection (“need-to-know”)
- Data retention/deletion plan

Evidence:
- Consent script or policy
- Data flow notes

---

## 7) Deployment Practicality (0–3)
- Works offline-first where possible
- Supports SMS/USSD or lightweight interfaces (if relevant)
- Clear monitoring + maintenance plan

Evidence:
- Deployment checklist
- Monitoring plan

---

## Overall Rating
- Total score (0–21):
- Key risks:
- Next improvements:
- Decision: Pilot / Extend testing / Do not deploy
