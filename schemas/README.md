# Schemas

This folder defines minimal, practical schemas for climate-smart agriculture datasets.

Goal: enable consistent data capture across farms, regions, and tools.

Files:
- `farm.json` — farm profile & location
- `soil.json` — soil measurements
- `pest_observation.json` — pest/disease observations
- `weather_daily.json` — daily weather summary
